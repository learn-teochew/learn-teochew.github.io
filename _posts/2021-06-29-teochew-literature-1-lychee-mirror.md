title: Teochew Literature (1) - Tale of the Lychee Mirror 《荔鏡記》

We often hear that Teochew, like other “dialects” are spoken but not
written, 有音無字 u6im1 bho5ri7. Therefore, some of us may be surprised to
learn that there is traditional written literature in Teochew. 

It’s true that in the pre-modern era, most Chinese texts were written in
literary Chinese. That was because most writing was done by literati who were
trained in this artificial language. However, some texts in the vernacular,
spoken languages have survived to the present day.

The Tale of the Lychee Mirror 《荔鏡記》 Li6gian3-gi3 is an opera written in
Southern China during the Ming era, around the mid-16th century. The story may
be better known as 陳三五娘 Dang5-san1 Ngou6-niê5 (the third son of the Dang5
family and the fifth daughter of the Ng5 family), and is also retold in many
folk songs and other operatic adaptations in both Hokkien and Teochew. If you
have older relatives who know Teochew opera, they will almost certainly be
familiar with these names. It’s likely that the story has been around for a
long time, and that 《荔鏡記》 simply happens to be the oldest surviving
printed version out of many.

Dang5 San1 陳三 was a scholar and a native of 泉州 Zuan5ziu1 (part of Hokkien
province, in Hokkien: Choân-chiu), and while traveling through the Teochew
region, encountered Ng5 Ngou6-niê5 黃五娘 during the Nguang5siao1 元宵 Lantern
Festival, and the two then fell in love. The rest of the story describes the
many difficulties the couple had to endure before they could be together (no
spoilers!).

The earliest available editions of the Li6gian3-gi3 date from 1566 and 1581,
and are among the earliest texts written in vernacular Southern Min. The play
is partly written in Zuan5ziu1 Hokkien, and partly in Teochew. Because the text
is written with Chinese characters, it is sometimes difficult to identify the
original Teochew or Hokkien words behind them. Sometimes a corresponding
literary Chinese word is borrowed to substitute for the vernacular word
(semantic borrowing), or characters with similar pronunciation are used to
spell out words that don’t have a standard character (phonetic borrowing). Many
Teochew vocabulary terms in Li6gian3-gi3 and other Ming-era vernacular plays
have been identified in a study by Zeng Xiantong 曾憲通 (1991). 

Zeng commented that much of the play is written in a more literary style, but
some parts use vernacular language that is close to how people really speak,
and which he says would still be understood today. One of these that he
annotated in his article is “The Wife-less Man’s Lament”, a song by a man
complaining about life without a wife.

There are only a few copies of the play in existence, in different editions
dating from the Ming and Qing periods. The latest one to be rediscovered was
found in the National Library of Scotland only a few years ago by a PhD student
named Wang Yibo (2019), in a book collection that was originally acquired by a
missionary John Steele who lived and taught for many years in Swatow. Wang’s
PhD thesis contains a useful overview of the scholarly literature around this
text.

Below we reproduce the text of the song, with transcription in modern
pronunciation (based on Zeng, 1991; we don’t exactly know the historical
pronunciation) and a translation into English.
