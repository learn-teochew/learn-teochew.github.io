title: Teochew literature (2) - Reciting classical poetry in Teochew

Imagine a scholar or pupil from the old times reciting classical Chinese
poetry... in your imagination, were they swivelling their heads with each
verse? If so, you might have watched too many period dramas on TV. And did
they recite it in Mandarin? 

What if they were using their own “dialects” to recite the classics?

In this recording, an old woman from Têng'hai 澄海 district uses Teochew to recite
the beginning of a famous poem by Sou Sêg (蘇軾 Su Shi), “Ode of the Red
Cliffs” (transcription below). The video was posted by the Hong
Kong Teochew Culture Association on their YouTube channel. In addition to using
the Teochew pronunciation, she is also using a half-singing style of
recitation, that has been called “chanting” or “cantillation”. The melody and
rhythm of chanting helps in memorizing the text.

Before the 1920s, Chinese schoolchildren learned to read and write in Literary
Chinese (文言 bhung5ngang5, also called 漢文 hang3bhung5), but when they read
it out loud, they did not pronounce the words in modern Mandarin but with the
pronunciation of their own “dialects”. Today, the only place where something
like this is still the regular practice is Hong Kong, where pupils learn to
write in Standard Written Chinese (i.e.  Mandarin), but read it out loud with
Cantonese pronunciation.

Literary Chinese is a completely different language from Teochew and Mandarin,
just as Mandarin and Teochew are different from each other, even though they
are all conventionally written with Chinese characters. Therefore, it is more
accurate to say that a classical text is being recited “with Teochew
pronunciation”, instead of being recited “in Teochew”. Likewise, it is
incorrect to say that the original language of these poems is Mandarin.

This tradition shows the difference between vernacular and literary readings of
the same character (文白異讀 bhung5bêh8 ig4tag8), which we have discussed in
these pages before. It also shows how literary Chinese was really a book
language that every reader had to filter and make sense of through their own
vernacular spoken “dialect”.  There was no uniform standard, and each region
had their own tradition for the “correct” pronunciation. After Mandarin became
the language of mass education from the 1920s onwards, this tradition of
vernacular readings of literary Chinese gradually died out.

The tradition of chanting/cantillation in “dialect” was preserved on Taiwan,
however, where there are still a few practitioners keeping the art of chanting
verse in Taiwanese Southern Min alive.
