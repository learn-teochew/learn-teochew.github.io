Here is an interesting example of Teochew written with Chinese characters in
the 19th century, that I came across via [this Twitter
thread](https://twitter.com/justin_r_leung/status/1760499137596871167). Many
thanks to the participants @airin_lvr, Justin, Elijah, and Egas for a
stimulating exchange. 

In the Introduction to the 1874 Chinese dictionary compiled by Samuel Wells
Williams, *Syllabic dictionary of the Chinese language arranged according to
the Wu-Fang Yuen Yin, with the pronunciation of the characters as heard in
Peking, Canton, Amoy, and Shanghai* (Shanghai: American Mission Press), there
is a side-by-side comparison of the same literary Chinese text translated into
different regional vernacular languages, including Swatow Teochew. These appear
to have been contributed by informants from different parts of China. 

Williams’s aim was to show how different the literary “book style” is from the
vernaculars, and how different the regional vernaculars are from each other. As
he points out, “only in the ... examples from Peking and Hankow, are all the
characters used in their proper signification.” I.e. regional vernaculars like
Teochew often use characters to write words that are not cognate to what those
characters represent in the literary language. They may be used because their
pronunciation is similar (phonetic gloss), or because they have a similar
meaning (semantic gloss). An example of a phonetic gloss is the spelling 做年
for Teochew zo3ni5 (“how”).

This text is a good example for vernacular character usages that were in use at
the time. For Teochew, the usages here are similar to those in late 19th/early
20th century Teochew songbooks (I’ve been keeping a
[list](https://zh.wikisource.org/wiki/User:Kbseah#%E6%BD%AE%E5%B7%9E%E6%96%B9%E8%A8%80%E4%BF%97%E5%AD%97)
of examples I’ve observed on Chinese Wikisource) and other texts from that era.
There was no standard for written vernaculars, but some of these usages go back
to the Ming era and possibly even earlier (see 曾宪通 (1991).
明本潮州戏文所见潮州方言述略《方言》 1991 (1) : 10-29). Unfortunately this
informal tradition of written Teochew is mostly gone today.

It is through a bit of a fluke that we have this example text in Teochew.
Elsewhere in the dictionary, Williams used Amoy Hokkien to represent the
Southern Min variety of Chinese. However, when it came to documenting not just
the pronunciation of individual characters but an actual vernacular
translation, “[t]he teachers at Amoy declared themselves unable to write their
colloquial intelligibly.” Just like Teochew, there are Hokkien texts written in
Chinese characters (their written traditions overlapped because these
vernaculars are closely related and come from neighboring regions), but perhaps
they did not agree on which variant characters to use, or did not think that
they were sufficiently orthodox to warrant publication.

The base text is an extract from the [Sacred Edit of the Kangxi
Emperor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacred_Edict_of_the_Kangxi_Emperor)
聖諭廣訓, an instructional text written in simple literary Chinese that was
distributed throughout China to educate local populations on Confucian values.
Local literati were supposed to hold public lectures explaining the text in
their local vernaculars. The full text is available on
[Wikisource](https://zh.wikisource.org/wiki/%E8%81%96%E8%AB%AD%E5%BB%A3%E8%A8%93_(%E5%9B%9B%E5%BA%AB%E5%85%A8%E6%9B%B8%E6%9C%AC)).

The Teochew (marked below with 潮) and English versions are from the *Syllabic
Dictionary* (page XLII onwards, [digitized by Harvard University
Libraries](https://nrs.lib.harvard.edu/urn-3:fhcl:32420574?n=46)). I have added
a Pêng’im transcription and notes.
