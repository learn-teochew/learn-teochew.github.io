How do we count one-two-three in Teochew? Hokkien and Teochew use the same character to write “two”, but pronounce it differently. A-Cion-He is wondering whether it should be “zêg-no-san” or “zêg-nng-san”...

The Hokkien pronunciation of 兩 is different between different regions and dialects. In Tsiang-tsiu, the pronunciation is more similar to Teochew “no6”, whereas in Amoy and Tsuan-tsiu it is “nng”. 

 * Teochew: 兩 no6 /no³⁵/
 * Hokkien: 兩 nn̄g /nŋ̍³³/ in Amoy, Tsuân-tsiu, but nōo /nɔ̃²²/ in Tsiang-tsiu
