Today is Nguang-siao 元宵, the 15th day of the lunar New Year, also known as
the Lantern Festival, when people go out to admire beautiful lantern displays
and solve riddles. Maybe you might find your true love under the lanterns, like
the story of Dang-san and Ngou-nio 陳三五娘, who first encounter each other in
Dio-ziu at the Nguang-siao festival.

There are different operas based on this story, in both Hokkien and Teochew
opera traditions, because it is well known in both regions. After all,
Dang-san’s hometown is near the Hokkien city of Zuan-ziu 泉州.

You can enjoy the music, choreography, and humor of the opera from the comfort
of home, because the 1961 version has been uploaded to YouTube by Teochew opera
fans. If you need some help understanding the Teochew, we have transcribed the
Teochew with both Pêng’im and characters, and also translated it into English
[here](https://learn-teochew.github.io/tc-opera/transcriptions/).

Here is an excerpt from the song that Ngou-nio sings when she first steps out
of the house to see the lanterns:

\*\*\*

cug guin-mung, hi bug-zing

出閨門 喜不盡

Stepping out of the inner courtyard’s confines is joy beyond compare

\*\*\*

mag-zoin gêng-muêh ring cêng-sing

目前景物盡清新

The scene before my eyes is so refreshing and new.

\*\*\*

dêng ru cên, ghuêh ru gian

燈如星、月如鏡

Lanterns like stars, the moon like a mirror.

\*\*\*

huê-ciu-ngeng-huê bug-mên sian

火樹銀花 不夜 城

The fireworks’ brilliant sparkle make this a city without night.
