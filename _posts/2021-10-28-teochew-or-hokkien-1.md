Teochew and Hokkien are closely related languages. In communities where both
are spoken, like in Singapore and Penang, speakers may freely mix them
together. Younger heritage speakers may not be fully aware what's the
difference between the two.

In this new series of posts, we'll introduce some common words that are
different between Hokkien and Teochew. Do you know which is which? If you are a
Teochew speaker, do you also understand the Hokkien word?

Pronunciations are given in Teochew Pêng'im (or closest approximation, for
Hokkien) and IPA. Hokkien pronunciation follows the Amoy dialect. In the
answers below, Hokkien is written with Tâi-lô.

Today's word means "to say". Which one is Teochew?
