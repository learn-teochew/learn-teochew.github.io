In a [previous post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2021-06-29-teochew-literature-1-lychee-mirror.md %})
we introduced one of the earliest known historical Teochew/Minnan opera
scripts, the *Li-gian-gi* 《荔鏡記》“Tale of the Lychee Mirror”, which was
published in the 16th century during the Ming era. Modern adaptations of the
opera, under the name *Dang-san Ngou-niê* 陳三五娘 are still popular today,
however the scripts have been almost completely rewritten.

If you want to read the original versions, the best way to start would probably
be to use a modern edition or transcription, e.g. those published by Wu
Shou-li, because these clarify parts of the text that are difficult to read,
use standard characters, and have puncutation. 

However, if you want to see what the original books from several hundred years
ago look like, you can find many of them online. The Bodleian Library has a

of the Li-gian-gi freely available. However some help may be necessary to
understand how to read these historical editions.

In this series, we’ll be introducing some of the conventions and features of
these texts that are likely to be unfamiliar to modern readers. We hope that
this will make them less mystifying for you, and that you will enjoy the
process of discovering them as real books, and not just pretty artefacts to
admire.

First of all: Did you know that the Li-gian-gi is actually two books in one?

It was common practice for publishers to include different books in the same
printed volume. Maybe this was because it was more economical: perhaps if each
book was too short, it was more expensive to carve separate woodblocks? Or
maybe it was to entice readers to buy a new book by bundling it with another
one that was known to be popular.

Unlike what you might expect, these two books were not back-to-back, but
printed in parallel on the same pages. The upper part (“register”) of each page
consists of selections from a Minnan opera known as 顏臣, while the text of the
Li-gian-gi is in the lower register. Between the two are illustrations
depicting scenes in the Li-gian-gi. To save money, publishers were also known
to re-use woodblock illustrations from different books, just changing the
captions.
