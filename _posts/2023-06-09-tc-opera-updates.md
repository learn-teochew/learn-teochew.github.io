We have made some updates to the [Learn Teochew
Opera](https://learn-teochew.github.io/tc-opera/) website, to bring more
information on Teochew opera to our readers. Some of these changes were done
over the course of the past year but we summarize them together here.

 * Added suggestions for further reading
 * Complete Pêngim transcription and English translation of 陳三五娘 *Dang-san
   Ngou-niê* [now available](https://learn-teochew.github.io/tc-opera/transcriptions/)
 * Tidied up description of historical Teochew opera scripts, and added [our
   explainer](https://learn-teochew.github.io/tc-opera/historical-scripts/) on
   how to read them.

Hope that our readers will find these useful, please leave feedback if you find
errors or have suggestions for improvement!
