Teochew songbooks *Die-ziu go-cêh* 潮州歌冊 contain songs that were recited out loud as a form of entertainment in Teochew communities, usually among women. This tradition is no longer widely practised by younger generations, but many songbooks have been handed down to the present day.

Although we translate the word *go* 歌 as "song", they are not pieces with fixed melodies but were recited or chanted in a rhythmic way without musical instruments. Other regions have similar traditions, like the Cantonese “wooden fish songs” 木魚歌, and Hokkien “kua-a-cheh” 歌仔冊.

Printed songbooks that exist today mostly date from the late Qing and early Republic period, but it is likely that many of them recorded songs that were already circulating in the community for a long time. Printing allowed popular songs to be distributed much faster and much further than word of mouth, even to overseas Teochew communities living outside of China. They are a rare example of vernacular Teochew language in written or printed form.

The songs often adapted popular stories from Teochew opera or classic tales, but some were also original works.

Teochew songbook verses typically have the following structure: 

 * Each line is seven syllables long, grouped into verses of four lines each. 
 * The poem is recited with a regular beat. All syllables have the same length, except the last syllable in each line which lasts for two beats.
 * The first, second, and fourth lines of each verse end with rhyming syllables that belong to the “level” *pêng* 平 tone category (tone 1 陰平 or tone 5 陽平).
 * Whereas the third line ends with a *zêh* 仄 syllable (any tone except 1 and 5). 

In this post, we have transcribed part of a song recited by an old woman from a Youtube video. The transcription into Chinese characters was originally made by YouTube user “bi chia” in a comment on the video. We have added the phonetic transcription and a rough translation (where unsure about the translation, we have marked it as [...]).

The example below has typical seven-syllable lines, four-line verses, and AABA rhyme structure. For example, the rhyming syllables of the first verse (lines 1, 2, 4) are *zai1* 知, *kai1* 開, and *lai5* 來 (all *pêng* tones), while the third line ends in *se7* 事 which is a *zêh* tone.
